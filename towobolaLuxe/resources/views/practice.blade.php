<h1>The Life of a Blog Post</h1>

<p>
  A blog post starts with an idea. The writer sits down, opens a blank document, and types the <em>first sentence</em>.
  Sometimes the first sentence is <i>quiet</i> and subtle, other times it is <b>bold</b> and demanding of attention.
</p>

<h2>Planning and Structure</h2>

<p>
  Before writing, you decide the structure: a main title, one or more section headings, and paragraphs under each heading.
  You might think: "Should this section be technical or conversational?" — here we usually choose clarity first and tone second.
  Use <strong>clear headings</strong> so readers can scan quickly.
</p>

<h3>Headings Matter</h3>

<p>
  Headings like <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code> tell readers and search engines what the page is about.
  For example, the main title goes in <strong>h1</strong>, major sections use <strong>h2</strong>, and subsections use <strong>h3</strong>.
</p>

<h2>Writing the Paragraphs</h2>

<p>
  Paragraphs are the building blocks. A paragraph should contain one main idea.
  Within a paragraph you can emphasize a word with <em>emphasis</em> or mark something as important with <strong>strong text</strong>.
  If you want a lighter emphasis you can use <i>italic</i>, but when meaning matters use <em>semantic emphasis</em>.
</p>

<p>
  Example: The chemical formula for water is H<sub>2</sub>O, and Einstein's famous equation is E = mc<sup>2</sup>.
  Use <sub>subscript</sub> and <sup>superscript</sup> when you need to show formulas, footnote numbers, or mathematical powers.
</p>

<h2>Style vs. Semantics</h2>

<p>
  There is a difference between styling-only tags and semantic tags.
  <b>Bold</b> and <i>italic</i> change how text looks, while <strong>strong</strong> and <em>em</em> also communicate meaning to screen readers and search engines.
  When possible, prefer <strong>semantic tags</strong> for accessibility.
</p>

<h2>Putting It All Together</h2>

<p>
  A short example section in a post might look like this: <em>Introduction.</em> Then one or two paragraphs that explain the idea.
  If you need to highlight a phrase, use <strong>strong</strong>; if you need to show a quote or aside, use <i>italic</i> or wrap it in a new paragraph.
</p>

<p>
  Final note: always preview your post. Make sure headings are in order, paragraphs read well, and any <sub>subscripts</sub> or <sup>superscripts</sup> display correctly.
  Good writing combines structure, clarity, and small touches like <em>emphasis</em> when needed.
